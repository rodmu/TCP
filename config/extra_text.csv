Diese hatten die überraschende Einnahme operativ wichtiger Angriffsziele, Sabotage oder die Kooperation mit verbündeten politischen Gruppierungen zum Ziel. Zum Jahreswechsel 1942/43 erfolgte aus verschiedenen Gründen ein Umdenken gegenüber dem Sonderverband Brandenburg. Aufgrund der allmählich prekären Lage an den Fronten und um die großen personellen Verluste auszugleichen, musste die Einheit deshalb zunehmend als normale Fronttruppe verwendet werden.

EVT_3127006_DESC;Little Entente , loose alliance formed in 192021 by Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Its specific purposes were the containment of Hungarian revisionism (of the terms of the World War I peace treaty) and the prevention of a restoration of the Hapsburgs. The three nations were drawn together by three bilateral treaties of defensive and economic alliance. This combination eventually became closely bound to France by financial and treaty obligations, and Poland sometimes cooperated with it but did not enter the alliance. Yugoslavia and Romania were also members of the Balkan Entente, formed in 1934. The overall aims of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente, taken together, were the preservation of the territorial status quo, established by the treaties of Versailles, Saint-Germain, Trianon, and Neuilly, against the efforts of Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Bulgaria to have those treaties revised, the prevention of Anschluss, or union, between Germany and Austria and the encouragement of closer economic ties among its members. The Little Entente was successful in its aims until the rise of Hitler in Germany, when French prestige was gradually displaced by German economic penetration and political pressure. It began to break apart in 1936 and was effectively ended when Czechoslovakia lost its membership by the formation of the Munich Pact.;;;;Die 'kleine Entente' war eine lose Allianz zwischen Rumänien, Jugoslawien und der Tschechoslowakei, die 1920 gegründet wurde. Ihre Ziele bestanden darin, den ungarischen Revisionismus einzudämmen und zu verhindern, daß noch einmal ein Habsburger den Thron besteigt. Die drei Nationen waren durch bilaterale Verträge aneinander gebunden, die eine militärische und wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit beinhalteten. Zwischenzeitlich näherte sich diese Entente aus finanziellen und vertragstechnischen Gründen an Frankreich an und auch Polen arbeitete zeitweise mit ihnen zusammen, ohne jedoch beizutreten.

Beide Bündnissysteme hatten als gemeinsames Ziel, den territorialen Status Quo, der in den Verträgen von Versailles, Saint-Germain, Trianon und Neuilly festgeschrieben wurde, beizubehalten, während das deutsche Reich, Italien, Ungarn und Bulgarien diese Verträge gerne überarbeitet hätten. Im einzelnen waren die Ziele die Verhinderung eines Anschlusses von Österreich an das deutsche Reich und eine engere wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit der Mitgliedsländer.

EVT_3136115_DESC;Germany maintained a strong economic mission in China under von Seeckt since 1934. In 1936, many in the German command believed the time had come to change the focus of German aid to China. As the Chinese Kuomintang was fighting against Communism in the Far East, Germany provided railroad and manufacturing technology, uniforms, ammunition, armored scout cars, and many other military supplies to China. The new head of the German mission, Alexander von Falkenhausen, was very interested in helping in the struggle against the Communists. He offered to organise the training of 60 Chinese divisions up to German standards. In return, Germany asked for tungsten and other strategic materials, none of which were of much use to Chinese industry. This increase in international involvement signalled Germany's resurgence in international politics.;;;;Seit 1934 unterhielt das deutsche Reich unter von Seeckt starke wirtschaftliche Beziehungen zu China. 1936 kamen im deutschen Oberkommando Diskussionen auf, sich auf andere Bereiche der Hilfe für China zu konzentrieren.

Der neue Leiter der deutschen Mission in China, Alexander von Falkenhausen, war sehr daran interessiert, bei den Kämpfen gegen die Kommunisten zu helfen und bot an, 60 chinesische Divisionen auszubilden und auf deutschen Standard zu bringen.

At this time, Hitler did not wish to disturb his relations with the sympathetic Vichy French regime and Franco obviously didn't want to risk his position gained in three years of civil war.\nSpain will ally with Germany in exchange for enormous subsidies and - more importantly - a large part of French North Africa.

EVT_222007_DESC;Despite the Sikorski-Mayski agreement, creating a Polish army in the USSR met with several problems. The Polish government wanted to use the Polish Army as one solid force, securing a future political system after the war. In contrast, Stalin was only interested in sending the newly raised divisions to the front one by one, as classic cannon fodder. Stabilization of the front lines also resulted in lowering Stalins interest in creating a Polish army. As a result of these problems, the idea of withdrawing the troops to the Brittish Middle East, was welcomed with relief by both sides.;;;;Die Bildung einer polnischen Armee in Russland stiess auf einige schwerwiegende Probleme. Während die polnische Regierung die Armee als ganzes einsetzen wollte ( auch in Hinblick auf die Sicherung eines zukünftigen polnischen Staates ), hatte Stalin die Idee, die polnischen Divisionen einzeln einzusetzen und sie als Kanonnenfutter zu benutzen. Je mehr sich allerdings die Fronten stabilisierten, umso weniger Interesse hatte Stalin an der Gründung dieser Armee.

Stalin recognized Japan as an important enemy of the USSR and according to this doctrine he supported Nationalist China and Mongolia to counter Japanesse presence on the Asian continent. As a result of growing tension between the two countries, in 1938 Japanese Army units crossed the Soviet border near Lake Chasan to probe Red Army defences. The Soviet Far East Army counterattacked, but its advance was slow and fights lasted until the end of August. The lack of effectiveness of the Far East Soviet forces cost the life of their commander, Vasilij Blücher.

Stalin betrachtete Japan als einen der grossen Feinde der Sowjetunion und unterstützte dementsprechend National-China und die Mongolei, um dem japanischen Einfluss auf dem asiatischen Kontinent zu begegnen. Als ein Ergebnis der Spannung dieser beiden Länder ist zu betrachten, daß 1938 japanische Streitkräfte die Grenze am See von Chasan überschritten, um die Verteidigungsbereitschaft der Sowjetunion auf die Probe zu stellen. Die Sowjetunion startete einen Gegenagriff, der aber nur langsam vorankam. Die Kämpfe dauerten bis in den August 1938.

Mussolini saw Montenegro as a future part of an Imperial Italy that would span the Adriatic coast to northern Greece (incorporating the lands once controlled by Venice). Montenegro was nominally a Kingdom, but the last King's grandson Prince Michael Petrovic-Njegos refused the crown, declaring loyalty to his cousin, young King Peter II of Yugoslavia. Two Romanov princes, Prince Nicholas Romanovich of Russia and his father Prince Roman Petrovich also refused the crown, so Italian governors ran Montenegro instead.

The much larger Peruvian army of 13,000 men, supported by a battalion of armor,  together with artillery and air support moved quickly into the southern  coastal province of El Oro, threatening Guayaquil. The fewer than 1,800  Ecuadorian troops in the area lacked air cover and could offer only limited  resistance. The Ecuadorian president's fear of being left unprotected from his  political opponents led him to keep the nation's best fighting forces in Quito.  Peruvian forces also moved into the disputed Amazonian territory without  significant opposition. After a campaign lasting only three weeks, an armistice  was arranged. The Rio Protocol of February 1942 awarded to Peru some 205,000 square kilometers of previously disputed Amazon territory. The subsequent Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries imposed on Ecuador acceptance of Peru's claims in the Amazonian region in return for Peruvian withdrawal from Ecuador's coastal provinces.;;;;Ekuador war auf die Invasion der Peruaner nicht vorbereitet.

Den weniger als 1.800 ekuadorianischen Soldaten in diesem Gebiet mangelte es an der erforderlichen Absicherung gegen Luftangriffe und sie konnten nur verhalten Widerstand leisten. Die Angst des ekuadorianischen Präsidenten vor seinen politischen Gegnern führte dazu, dass er die besten Streitkräfte der Nation in Quito einbehielt und so besetzten die peruanischen Streitkräfte das umstrittene Territorium am Amazonas ohne nennenswerten Widerstand. Nach diesem Feldzug, der lediglich drei Wochen dauerte, wurde ein Waffenstillstand ausgehandelt. Das Rio Protokoll vom Februar 1942 sprach Peru die Kontrolle über ca. 205.000 Quadratkilometer des strittigen Amazonasgebietes zu.

Nachfolgend wurde dann 1830 das Pedermonte-Mosquera-Protokoll unterschrieben. Diese Vereinbarung bestimmt den Marañon-Amazon-Fluss als die Grenze zwischen Ekuador und Peru. Dennoch focht Peru diese Übereinkunft energisch an. Zwischen 1936 und 1938 versuchten Abgesandte aus Peru und Ecuador vergeblich, einen für beide Seiten genehmen Vertrag in Washington auszuhandeln.;;;;;;x

Es war eine flexible Regierungsform die auf einem Bündnis der Arbeiterklasse, der Bauernschaft, der unteren Mittelklasse und den nationalen Kapitalisten beruhte. Dieses Programm begünstigte das Wachstum kleiner Industrie - und Handwerksbetriebe ( unter anderem auch durch die Einführung industrieller Kooperativen ) und verbeserte die wirtschaftliche Lage der Landbevölkerung. Zur selben Zeit begann Mao mit schwerer Selbstkritik an seinem kommunistischen China und änderte dessen politische Ausrichtung. Wenn man bislang einem Weg des reinen und, notwendigerweise, abstrakten Marxismus gegangen war, wollte man nun eine auf China zugeschnittene Version des Marxismus leben. Während dieser Zeit hatte die kommunistische Partei eine sehr enge Bindung an die Landbevölkerung und wusste sehr genau, wie sie die Bevölkerung in eine Richtung nationaler Hassgefühle gegenüber Japan zu bewegen hatte. ;In 1940, Mao came up with a new political program in his 'New Democracy'.

März 1938: Gestern wurden in Österreich die Reservisten einberufen, die Arbeiterschaft stellte sich uneingeschränkt hinter von Schuschnigg. Gegen 10 Uhr forderte Dr. Edmund von Glaise-Horstenau, Minister ohne Aufgabenbereich, das die Volksabstimmung geheim durchzuführen sei. Um 15 Uhr forderte das deutsche Reich durch Dr. Wilhelm Keppler die Verschiebiung der Abstimmung um 6 Wochen und die Ersetzung von Schuschniggs durch Seyss-Inquart. Die erste Forderung wurde erfüllt, die zweite nicht. Um 18:30 liess das deutsche Reich durch seinen Militärattache in Wien, Generalleutnant Muff, verlauten, daß 200.000 Mann der deutschen Wehrmacht die Grenzen zu Österreich überschreiten würden, wenn nicht von Schuschnigg zurückträte, Seyss-Inquart zum Kanzler ernannt, zwei Drittel der Regierung aus Nationalsozialisten bestehe, jegliche Behinderung der österreichischen nationalsozialistischen Partei aufhöre und alle des Landes verwiesenen Nationalsozialisten wieder zurückkehren dürften. Von Schuswchnigg trat um 19:30 von allen Ämtern zurück und sein Nachfolger Seyss-Inquart ersuchte das deutsche Reich um Hilfe, da die Bewaffnung kommunistischer Gruppierungen alarmierende Ausmaße angenommen habe. Er ordnete an, daß den einrückenden deutschen Truppen kein Widerstand zu leisten sei und erinnerte die Exekutive daran, daß die Aufrechterhaltung der öffentlichen Ordnung ihre oberste Aufgabe sei. Frankreich und das vereinte Königreich protestierten und stellten fest, daß die Ausübung von Druck, unterstützt von Waffengewalt, gegen einen souveränen Staat eine Situation herstellt, die unvereinbar mit der Unabhängigkeit dieses Staates sei.;March 12, 1938.

EVT_40000000_DESC;The Guards Armoured Division was formed on 17 June 1941. The division remained in the United Kingdom, training, until 26 June 1944, when it landed in Normandy as part of VIII Corps. Its first major engagement was Operation Goodwood, the attack by three armoured divisions towards Bourguebus Ridge in an attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead. That was followed by Operation Bluecoat, the advance east of Caen as the Falaise pocket formed. Transferred to XXX Corps, the division liberated Brussels. It led the XXX Corps attack in Operation Market Garden, the ground forces' advance to relieve airborne troops aiming to seize the bridges up to Arnhem, capturing Nijmegen bridge in conjunction with American paratroopers. During the battle of the Bulge, it was sent to the Meuse as a reserve in case the Germans broke through the American lines. It endured hard fighting in Operation Veritable, the advance towards the Rhine through the Reichswald, and again in the advance through Germany. The division existed until 12 June 1945, when it was reorganised as an infantry division, the Guards Division.;;;;Die Guards Armoured Division wurde am 17. Juni 1941 aufgestellt.

Ihren ersten Einsatz bestritt die Division während der Operation Goodwood, wo es ihr im Verband mit 2 weiteren Panzerdivisionen gelang aus dem Normandiebrückenkopf auszubrechen. Sie war später an der Einnahme von Caen sowie an der Schlacht um den Falaise-Kessel beteiligt. Anschließend wurde sie dem XXX. Korps unterstellt. Es folgte die Befreiung von Brüssel. Im September 1944 übernahm die Division die Speerspitze der alliierten Luftlandeoprtation Market Garden. Mit dem Ziel der Einnahme der Brücke von Arnheim vor Augen gelang der Division die Eroberung von Nijwegen. Die US Fallschirmjäger und die Panzerspitzen der Guards Armoured Division blieben wenige Kilometer vor Arnheim durch schwere deutsche Gegenangriffe liegen. Die Division nahm viele der sich zurückziehenden britische Soldaten aus Arnheim auf. Während der Ardennenschlacht bildete die Division die strategische Reserve hinter den US Linien an der Maas. Während der schweren Gefechte um den Reichswald gelang der Division der Durchbruch zum Rhein sowie dessen Überschreitung. Am 12. Juni 1945 wurde die Gurads Armoured Division in die Guards Division, eine Infanterie-Division, umgegliedert.;;;;;;X

The Kriegsmarine had a significant numerical advantage over the Polish Navy, and in the event of a war the Polish High Command realized that the ships which remained in the small and mostly landlocked Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Also, the Danish straits were well within operation range of the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe, so there was little chance for the plan to succeed if implemented after hostilities began.

Das Baltikum - nach einem Zusatzabkommen auch Litauen - gelangte unter den Einfluss Stalins. Damit wurde einerseits der Weg für eine Reintegration der im 1. Weltkrieg 'verlorenen' Gebiete geebnet und andererseits der Sorge begegnet, Deutschland könne die Länder als Aufmarschgebiet für einen schnellen Vorstoß auf das nahe Leningrad nutzen.\nUmgehend nach Ende des Polenfeldzugs zwangen die Sowjets alle drei Länder zum Abschluss gegenseitiger 'Beistandsverträge', welche die Einrichtung militärischer Basen erlaubten. Bis zu 75.000 Soldaten der Roten Armee konnten nun im Baltikum stationiert werden. Finnland hatte einen vergleichbaren Vertrag zunächst abgelehnt, musste aber im folgenden Winterkrieg letztlich doch klein beigeben. Im Gegensatz zu den Balten konnten sie allerdings ihre Unabhängigkeit bewahren.\nUnter dem Eindruck des deutschen Siegs über Frankreich verstärkte die Sowjetunion im Sommer 1940 den Druck auf das Baltikum. Die dortigen Regierungen wurden der Verschwörung beschuldigt und schließlich mit Ultimaten konfrontiert. Diese erzwangen den Grenzübertritt einer unbegrenzten Anzahl von Rotarmisten, was am 15. Juni zur Besetzung Litauens führte. Estland und Lettland folgten einen Tag später. Im Verlauf des kommenden Monats forderten 'Demonstranten' öffentlich einen Beitritt zur Sowjetunion, welcher innerhalb weniger Tage auch von den jeweiligen Marionettenregierungen offiziell beantragt wurde.

Ausgehend von der Sorge um die eigenen, aber zunehmend auch die europäischen Kunstschätze während des Zweiten Weltkrieges formierten sich in den USA Kunsthistoriker um Paul J. Sachs (Harvard University), um Maßnahmen zum Kulturgüterschutz zu organisieren. Die daraus entstandene Roberts Commission, benannt nach Owen Roberts, sorgte durch die Gründung der American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas am 23. Juni 1943 dafür, dass versierte und engagierte Kunstschutzoffiziere vor Ort in der Nähe des Frontverlaufs sein sollten, um Schäden an Kulturdenkmälern zu dokumentieren, Reparaturmaßnahmen einzuleiten, aber auch um präventiv tätig zu werden, indem man schützenswerte Architektur und Baudenkmäler benannte, die vor den Angriffen und bei der Inquartiernahme geschont werden sollten.;The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after World War II.

Man sah sich im Ausland um und wurde in Frankreich fündig. Mit der Armée de l'air wurde ein Verkauf von M.S. 406 Jagdflugzeugen ausgehandelt. Zwischen dem 4. und dem 29. Februar 1940 entsandte Frankreich 30 Maschinen. Die dt. Invasion Frankreichs verhinderte weitere Lieferungen. Finnland verhandelte mit Deutschland und bekam weitere M.S. 406 aus den Beutebeständen. Die ersten 30 französischen Jagdflugzeuge kamen bei der 28. Staffel (LeLv 29) zum Einsatz. Während des Winterkrieges flogen die M.S. 406 259 Missionen gegen die rote Luftwaffe. Dabei gelang den Finnen der Abschuss von 16 Feindmaschinen. Während des Fortsetzungskrieges stand die M.S. 406 in heftigen Luftkämpfen. Zwischen dem Novemeber 1939 und dem September 1944 errang die LeLv28 mit ihren M.S. 406 118 Luftsiege.;In 1940 Finnland had fought with the last reserves in the finnish-soviet Winter War.

France sent 30 Morane-Saulnier to Finland, between 4 and 29 February 1940. More aircraft should be send later but the german invasion of France stopped any french based shipment.

Weltkrieg ausbrauch, sah sich Schweden gezwungen seine Verteidigung gegen jede Form von Bedrohung neu zu organisieren. Das Abwehrprogramm von 1936 war nicht ausreichend, um das Land im Falle eines Krieges wirklich schützen zu können. Als der Krieg zwischen Deutschland und Russland 1941 eskalierte, berief die schwedische Regierung eine Expertengrupope ein, um ein neues Abwehrprogramm aufzustellen. Die schwedische Regierung entschloss sich mit einem neuen Programm das Militärbudget erneut zu erhöhen. Mit 755 Millionen Kronen umfasste es nun mehr als 4.6 Prozent des järhlichen Bruttoinlandproduktes. Mit dem Geld wurden neue Panzer, Handfeuerwaffen, Artilleriekanonen, Flugzeuge und Munition hergestellt. Die Armee stellte 2 neue Militärbezirke in Divisionsstärke auf. 4 Panzer-Regimenter wurden aufgestellt und bis 1944 mit mehr als 300 neuen Panzern ausgerüstet.

Außenpolitisch förderte er die Zusammenarbeit Ungarns mit Mussolinis Italien und Dollfuß Österreich. Zuletzt versuchte er mit dem nationalsozialistischen Deutschland zusammenzuarbeiten. Durch die Einführung der Wehrpflicht vergrößerte er die ungarische Armee. Seine autoritäre Politik brachte ihn zum Ende seiner Regierung hin in Konflikt mit den gemäßigten Konservativen.

The conservatives received this activity of his distrustfully. Horthy also expressed his discontent, that is why Darányi resigned on 11 May 1938. He was followed by Béla Imrédy in the position. Imrédys attempts to improve Hungarys diplomatic relations with Britain initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Imrédy realized that he could not afford to alienate the two fascist powers on a long term basis, however, and from the autumn of 1938 onward his foreign policy became increasingly pro-German and pro-Italian. Imrédy also worked to gain a base of power in Hungarian right wing politics, founding the Movement of Hungarian Life. He was quick to suppress any rivals in his quest for power, and influential fascists such as Ferenc Szálasi were harassed by Imrédys administration.;X

Hitler verlangte erstmals Anfang 1943, dass Kàllay abgesetzt würde. Dieser versuchte erfolglos, den Bündniswechsel zu verwirklichen. Nachdem Deutschland im März 1944 im 'Unternehmen Margarethe' Ungarn besetzt hatte, suchte Kállay am 19. März 1944 in der Türkischen Gesandtschaft Budapest Zuflucht. Mit dem Einmarsch der deutschen Wehrmacht in Ungarn sollte Reichsverweser Miklós Horthy einen Vertrauensmann zum Regierungschef ernennen. Allerdings weigerte er sich, den ihm persönlich verhassten Béla Imrédy zu betrauen. Deshalb brachte er den Namen Sztójays ins Gespräch, der zwar bei der deutschen Führung ebenfalls großes Vertrauen genoss, doch hoffte Horthy, dass Sztójay als Soldat ihm gegenüber loyal bleiben und nicht alle deutschen Anordnungen blindlings ausführen würde. Dieser Hintergedanke war auch den Deutschen bekannt, und zudem lehnte Sztójay zunächst aus gesundheitlichen Gründen ab. Schließlich jedoch konnte sich der neue reichsdeutsche Gesandte und Reichsbevollmächtigte Edmund Veesenmayer mit seiner Strategie durchsetzen, Horthy unter allen Umständen von einer Abdankung abzuhalten. So wurde Sztójay als Kompromisskandidat am 22. März zum Ministerpräsidenten und Außenminister ernannt.;Prime Minister Kállay supported the German war effort against the Soviet Union. However, he made numerous peaceful overtures to the Western Allies, even going as far as to promise to surrender to them unconditionally once they reached Hungary's borders. The Germans finally had enough of their ally's policies and occupied Hungary in March 1944, forcing Horthy to oust Kállay and replace him with the more pliable Döme Sztójay. As prime minister, Sztójay legalized Ferenc Szálasis Arrow Cross Party, increased Hungarian troop levels on the Eastern Front, dissolved the nations labor unions, jailed political opponents, and cracked down on left wing politicians and activists.

Die kommunistische Partei Bulgariens organisierte eine eigene Partisanenbewegung gegen die nationale Regierung, die Russland formell den Krieg miterklärt hatte. Ab August 1942 formierte eine Partisanenbewegung genannt "Vaterlandsfront", Kämpfer und Truppen in den südwestlichen, bergigen Regionen Bulgariens. Die Vaterlandsfront wurde durch die Kommunisten und andere linke Gruppen stark unterstützt. Die Bewegung gewann im Laufe des Krieges durch die deutschen Misserfolge und Niederlagen starken Zulauf, sodass die linken Gruppen 1944 sogar einen erfolgreichen Staatsstreich organisieren konnten. Im Zuge des Abfallens Rumäniens auf dem Achsenbündnis erklärte Bulgarien seine Neutralität und forderte Deutschland zum Abzug aller Soldaten auf.

Die Alliierten nutzten die Schlacht, um nach der Niederlagen Polens sich als Helfer bedrohter Staaten zu etablieren. Für England war Norwegen aber auch als potenzielles Aufmarschgebiet im finnischen Winterkrieg interessant. Nach dem Überfall der Roten Armee auf Finnland planten engagierte Militärs ein Eingreifen Englands auf Seiten Finnlands in diesen Krieg. Nebenbei hätte man so auch einen Grund gehabt Deutschland vom neutralen Schweden und dessen Erz endgültig zu isolieren sowie sich Basen für eine Intervention im Baltikum zu sichern. Frankreich sah in Norwegen eine gute Chance eine zweite Front gegen Deutschland fern der Heimat aufzubauen und so die Moral der heimischen Bevölkerung zu stärken. \n Die deutsche Wehrmacht und allen voran Hitler sahen im norwegischen Feldzug eine Chance die deutsche Waffenüberlegenheit vor dem entscheidendem Feldzug im Westen zu demonstrieren und zu untermauern. So hielten deutsche Wochenschau-Kamerateams den Vormarsch auf Film fest. Spezialeinheiten wie der Panzerzug Horstmann der PzAbtl zbV 40, benannt nach ihrem Kommandeur Oberleutnant Horstmann, waren stets im Fokus der Wochenschauteams. Mit ihren Neubaufahrzeugen Pz.Kpfw.VI, den weißen Elefanten, stiften sie Verwirrung und führten so die alliierten Geheimdienste, die aufgrund der NbFzs falsche Vorstellungen und Erwartungen über die dt. Panzerwaffe sammelten, hinters Licht. Sowjetische, englische und amerikanische Dienstanweisungen und Panzererkennungsvorschriften zeigten bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges die Neubaufahrzeuge als potenzielle Feindpanzer und Panzergefahren. ;The battle of Norway was - beside the brutal battles - a war of propaganda.

Weltkrieges. 13 StuKas unter Befehl von Gruppenkommandeur Hptm. Sigel der I./StG 76 stürzten während einer Vorführung über dem Truppenübungsplatz Neuhammer in Schlesien am 15. August 1939 ab. Alle 26 Besatzungsmitglieder kamen ums Leben. Ziel der Übung war ein Angriff auf Bodenziele. Die Wettererkundungsstaffel meldete eine Stunde vor Beginn des Manövers: Wolkenbank im Zielgebiet, 2/3 bedeckt, Wolkenhöhe 2000m, Wolkenuntergrenze bei 900m, darunter gute Erdsicht. Der Anflug erfolgte in 4000m. Im Sturz sollten die Wolken durchstoßen werden und vor dem Abfangen zwischen 300-400m sollte das Ziel ins Visier kommen. Die tatsächliche Wolkenuntergrenze lag jedoch nur bei rund 100m, was ein Erkennen der wirklichen Höhe über Boden und rechtzeitiges Abfangen des Sturzfluges fast unmöglich machte. Zudem war im steilen Sturzflug infolge Konzentration des Pilotens auf die Zielerkennung eine Benutzung des Höhenmessers fast unmöglich. Hauptmann Sigel ging als Erster in den Sturzflug über und durchstieß die geschlossene Wolkendecke statt bei vermeintlichen 900m in nur 100m Höhe.

In den 20er Jahren entwickelte eine Gruppe einflussreicher US-Militärs, die später führende Generäle wurden (wie Harold L. George, Henry H. Arnold, Carl A. Spaatz), Konzepte für Präzisionsangriffe bei Tage. Ihr Kredo war, dass man den Feind schlagen könne ohne sein Heer oder seine Marine schlagen zu müssen. Der Bomber alleine würde tief ins Feindesland fliegen und dort die Rüstungsindustrie und Verwaltungszentren zerstören. Um diese Doktrin allerdings mit den beschränkten Mitteln des US Army Air Corps realisieren zu können, hätten alle anderen Projekte und Investitionen in anderen Flieger wie Jäger und mittlere Bomber zu Gunsten des Aufbaus der strategischen Bomberwaffe beendet werden müssen. Unter diesen Vorstellungen schloß das US Army Air Corps Entwicklungsverträge mit verschiedenen US-Firmen, die einen Bomber entsprechend dieser Doktrin entwickeln und bauen sollten.

In dieser Position geriet Schacht im Laufe seiner Amtszeit mit dem Generalbevollmächtigten des Vierjahresplanes, Hermann Göring, aneinander. Schacht hatte große Bedenken gegen die Autarkiepolitik des Dritten Reiches. Im Falle der Synthese von Benzin aus Kohle kritisierte er die Unwirtschaftlichkeit des Verfahrens, im Fall des Vorhabens, Eisenerz nur aus deutschen Erzlagern zu decken, die geringe Qualität des deutschen Eisenerzes, was eine Autarkie unmöglich machen würde. Für Schacht war die Autarkiepolitik größtenteils Verschwendung von Ressourcen. Erschwerend kam hinzu, dass Hermann Göring zudem bei seiner Verfolgung des Vierjahresplans ständig in die Kompetenzen des Wirtschaftsministers eingriff, ohne dass Hitler dem Einhalt geboten hätte. Schacht war der Meinung, dass er in seinem Amt nicht mehr Ernst genommen würde und reichte daher im November 1937 sein Rücktrittsgesuch ein.

Dieser wurde am 28. Mai 1938 angewiesen, gegenüber der französischen Maginotlinie eine deutsche Festungslinie, den Westwall, zu errichten. Die OT wurde nach Kriegsbeginn vor allem für Baumaßnahmen in Deutschland und den besetzten Gebieten eingesetzt. Neben dem Westwall war die OT mit dem Bau von U-Boot-Bunkern, dem Atlantikwall sowie den V-Abschussbasen befasst. Später kam der Bau von Luftschuftbunkern sowie Untertageverlagerung von Industriebetrieben als weitere wichtige Schwerpunkte hinzu. Neben dt. Arbeitern nutze die OT auch Zwangsarbeiter, Kriegsgefangene und KZ-Häftlinge.

Dort wurde das Geschütz zu einem großen Erfolg. Viele Nationen, darunter Rumänien, kauften das Geschütz oder fertigten es in Lizenz. Die rumänische Armee hatte Mitte der 30iger entschieden die Armee umfassend zu modernisieren. Der Generalstab suchte unter anderem nach einer neuen schweren Flak. Der Stab entschied sich für die 7,5cm Flak von Vickers. Der Vertrag zwischen Vickers und der rumänischen Armee sah vor, dass Rumänien insgesamt 150 Vickers-Geschütze erwarb. Davon wurden 8 Batterien mit je 6 Geschützen von Vickers gebaut und geliefert. Die restlichen Geschütze wurden in den Resita-Waffenfabriken in Lizenz gefertigt.

Die Showa Stahlwerke gingen aus den Anshan Eisen- und Stahlwerken hervor, die seit 1918 Teil der südmandschurische Eisenbahngesellschaft waren. Die Wahl für die neuen Stahlwerke fiel aufgrund verschiedener Faktoren auf Anshan. Die Stadt lag nahe an den Takushan Eisenvorkommen und war an das mandschurische Eisenbahnnetz angeschlossen. 1933 wurden die alten Anshan Werke in Showa Stahlwerke umbenannt. Als Vorzeigeindustriekomplex und als Teil des japanischen Entwicklungsplanes für die Mandschurei wurden die Showa Werke weiter ausgebaut. Mit deutscher Hilfe und der Anwendung neuer Verfahren wie dem Krupp-Rennverfahren wurde die Stahlerzeugung drastisch gesteigert. Wurden in der ganzen Mandschurei zwischen 1931-32 nur 1 Millionen Tonnen Stahl erzeugt, wovon bereits die Hälfe in Anshan erzeugt wurde, so stiegt die Stahlproduktion bis 1938 auf 7 Millionen Tonnen Stahl. 1941 produzierten die Showa Stahlwerke über 1,75 Millionen Eisenbarren sowie 1 Millionen Tonnen veredelten Stahl. 1942 produzierten die Showa Werke schon 3,6 Millionen Tonne an Stahlerzeugnissen. Insgesamt stiegen die Showa Stahlwerke zu einem der größten Stahlerzeuger der Welt auf.\n Wir können nun den Ausbau der Showa Stahlwerke vorantreiben und unsere Stahlproduktion ausbauen.;The Showa Steel Works was a Japanese government-sponsored steel mill that was one of the showpieces of the industrialization program for Manchukuo in the late 1930s.

Als Teil der Jidosha Kogyo-Werke, dem Vorgänger von Isuzu, wurden die Dowa-Werke gegründet. Zu Beginn wurden bei Dowa nur die Entmontagen von gelieferten Fahrzeugen vorgenommen. Erst mit Ausbau von Zulieferbetrieben samt Infrastruktur begann die Produktion eigener Fahrzeuge. 1940 wurden die Dowa-Werke Teil der neuen mandschurischen Automobilwerke. Die Dowa-Fabriken bauten fast alle Fahrzeuge der Kwantung-Armee. Insgesamt erreichten die Dowa-Werke auf ihrem Höchststand eine Produktion von 5000 Fahrzeugen pro Jahr.

April 1941 brach im Irak ein Militärputsch unter der Führung des irakischen Nationalisten Rashid Ali aus, der ein Bündnis des Iraks mit dem deutschen Reich anstrebte. Während des anglo-irakischen Krieges, der vom 2. bis zum 31. Mai 1941 dauerte, hatten die Achsen mit der Duldung der Vichy-Regierung Flugzeuge und Material zur Unterstützung der im Irak putschenden Nationalisten über franz. Syrien in den Irak verlegt. Die Alliierten planten nun die Invasion Syriens und des Libanons, um weitere Verstärkung der Achsen für den Irak zu unterbinden und einen Aufmarsch von Achsentruppen in Syrien gegen die britischen Besitzungen in Ägypten und Palästina zu verhindern. Die Alliierten begannen am 8. Juni gegen dne Widerstand und Protest der Vichy-Regierung den Einmarsch in franz. Syrien und Libanon. Die vichy-französische Levante-Armee leistete erbitterten Widerstand gegen die aus Briten, Australiern, Indern, Freifranzosen und Tschechen bestehende alliierte Invasionsarmee. Allerdings sah sich die Vichy-Regierung mit dem australischen Einmarsch am 10. Juli in Beirut genötigt, einen Waffenstillstand zu ersuchen, da jeder weitere Widerstand zwecklos erschien. Am 14. Juli wurde der Friedensvertrag unterzeichnet und die Kontrolle von Syrien und dem Libanon ging an die alliierten Truppen über. Bereits Ende Juli reiste General de Gaulle nach Syrien, um die Verwaltung der Gebiete unter freifranzösischer Kontrolle neu zu gliedern. Der freifranzösische General Catroux wurde der neue hohe Kommissar für die Gebiete. Er sollte die Unabhängigkeit Syriens und des Libanons vorbereiten. Zudem übernahm er die Kontrolle über die besiegte Levante-Armee, um diese als Schutztruppe für Syrien und den Libanon zu reorganisieren und zu erhalten.;On 1 April 1941, the 1941 Iraqi coup d'état had taken place and Iraq had come under the control of Iraqi nationalists led by Rashid Ali, who appealed for German support.

Februar 1941 erließ Präsident Roosevelt die "Executive Order 8682" in deren Zuge die US-Streitkräfte begannen wichtige pazifische Inselstellungen gegen einen möglichen Angriff zu befestigen. Im Zuge des Washingtoner Marineabkommens war die militärische Befestigung von pazifischen Inseln untersagt worden. Japans Krieg gegen China sowie Japans offene Aufrüstung und Bewaffnung seiner Mandatsinseln zwang zu einem Umdenken in den USA. Entsprechend sollten nun wichtige Schlüsselpositionen wie Midway und Hawaii militärisch bewaffnet werden, um die US Pazifikküste gegen mögliche japanische Aggressionen schützen zu können. Als erster Schritt hob das US Marine Corps eine Anzahl von Marine Defense Battalions aus. Diese wenige Mann starken Einheiten umfassten 8 155mm Artilleriegeschütze sowie 30 Flakkanonen vom Kaliber 20mm, 37mm und 90mm (Letztere bildeten mit 18 Geschützen den Schwerpunkt). Zusätzlich begann die US Armee mit dem Umbau ihrer Hawaii Division. Die alte Karre-Division wurde in zwei neue Divisionen aufgeteilt. Die Hawaii Division bildete so den Kern der neuen 24. und 25. US-Division. Außerdem stellte das US Marine Corps noch einige Raider Battalions auf, die gezielt Garnisonen verstärken sollten. Die Vorbereitungen erwiesen sich als wertvoll im Kampf gegen die Japaner im Pazifikkrieg, da die US Truppen auf diesen Grundpfeilern ihre militärische Stärke auf- und ausbauen konnte.;On February 14, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8682 to create naval defenses areas in the central Pacific territories.

Die Littorio Division kämpfte ab 1936 als Freiwilligenverband der italienischen Armee im spanischen Bürgerkrieg, wo sie Erfahrungen im modernen Krieg sowie im Konzept des Kampfes der verbundenen Waffen sammeln konnte. Bereits in den 1930iger Jahren hatte die italienische Armee an neuen taktischen Doktrinen und Grundsätzen für einen kommenden neuen Krieg gearbeitet. Eines dieser Konzepte war der Guerra di Rapido Corso (Krieg der schnellen Entscheidungen), quasi eine italienische Variation des dt. Blitzkrieg-Konzeptes. Um die Schlagkraft der italienischen Armee zu verstärken und im Sinne des Krieges der schnellen Entscheidungen bestehen zu können, beschloss das ita. Oberkommando die Zahl der Panzer-Truppen weiter zu vergrößern. Die Littorio-Division wurde als Verband ausgewählt, der zur Panzer-Division umgegliedert werden sollte. Die Umgliederung begann im Frühjahr 1939 und war im Oktober 1939 abgeschlossen. Aufgrund der unzureichenden Kapazitäten der italienischen Rüstungsindustrie wurde die Division - wie ihre Schwesterverbände - mit leichten CV-Tanketten bewaffnet und ausgerüstet.

Auch wenn weiterhin sowjetische Ausbilder in Spanien verblieben, um spanische Soldaten auf die sowjetischen Panzer umzuschulen, so begann die Sowjetunion doch insgeheim mit dem Abzug der eigenen Soldaten und Offiziere. Zudem hatte die Sowjetunion mit der Entsendung von 50 BT-5 Panzern die letzten Panzer überhaupt nach Spanien verschifft. Infolge des Ausbleibens von neuen Panzern sowie dem Rückzug der Russen sah sich die republikanische Armee dazu gezwungen zu reagieren und die Panzertruppen neu zu organisieren. Im Oktober 1937 schlug Kolonel Sanchez Perales, kommandierender Offizier der republikanischen Panzertruppen, eine Reform der Panzertruppen vor. Die bestehenden Panzereinheiten, insgesamt 4 Brigaden und kleine Sondereinheiten, sollten in zwei Divisionen konzentriert werden. Diese Divisionen konnten nicht mit den Panzer-Divisionen des kommenden Weltkrieges verglichen werden, da sie weder eigene Infanterie oder Artillerie besaßen. Die Divisionen sollten lediglich der Schwerpunktbildung dienen. Die meisten anderen Generäle wollten allerdings die Panzer auf die Infanterie verteilen und wie im 1. Weltkrieg zur Steigerung der Feuerkraft der Infanterie aufbrauchen. Im Mai 1938 verfügten die Republikaner noch über 176 der 331 gelieferten Panzern sowie über 285 Panzerwagen und gepanzerte Trucks.

Als Vorgänger der Alpini können die Gebirgsmilizen der piemontesischen Armee betrachtet werden, die Italiens gebirgigen Grenzen zu schützen hatten. Die Alpini wurden lokal rekrutiert, in der Regel in den Alpen, aber auch in einigen Gebieten des Apennin. Durch die lokale Rekrutierung wurden bereits mit dem schwierigen Terrain vertraute, wehrfähige Männer eingezogen und auf ihr Wissen aufbauend weiter gezielt ausgebildet. Es war Tradition, geeignete Wehrpflichtige eines Bezirks jedes Jahr zu denselben Terminen zu den Alpini einzuberufen und sie nach Abschluss der Ausbildung geschlossen einem Bataillon zuzuweisen. Dies führte zu einer sehr starken Bindung der Alpini-Verbände zu ihren Rekrutierungsgebieten.\n \n Im November 1941 stellte die italienische Armee die 6. Aplini-Division 'Alpi Graie' auf. Die Division wurde aus Reserveverbänden der Aplini-Truppen formiert. Die Division wurde im Anschluss zur Bekämpfung der immer stärker werdenden Partisanenbedrohung auf den Balkan nach Montenegro verlegt. Hier kämpfte die Division bis 1943 in schweren Gefechten immer wieder gegen Partisaneneinheiten. Am Tag des italienischen Waffenstillstandsvertrages mit den Alliierten am 8. September 1943 befand sich die Division in Italien. Im Zuge des Waffenstillstandes löst sich die Division auf.

EVT_3131423_DESC;The Battle of Cable Street was a riot that took place on Sunday 4 October 1936 in Cable Street in London. It became known that the British Union of Fascists were organising a march through the heart of the East End - an area which then had a large Jewish population. Oswald Mosley, leader of the Fascists, planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in uniforms styled on those of Blackshirts through the East End. An estimated 100,000 residents of the area petitioned then Home Secretary John Simon to ban the march because of the strong likelihood of violence. He refused, and sent a police escort in an attempt to prevent anti-fascist protesters from disrupting the march. The Board of Deputies of British Jews denounced the march as anti-semitic and urged Jews to stay away. Phil Piratin, a member of the local branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain, quickly organised opposition forces. The anti-fascist groups built roadblocks in an attempt to prevent the march from taking place. The barricades were constructed near the junction with Christian Street. An estimated 20000 anti-fascist demonstrators turned out, and were met by 7000 police, who attempted to clear the road to permit the march of 3,000 fascists to proceed. The demonstrators fought back with improvised weapons. After a series of running battles, Mosley agreed to abandon the march to prevent bloodshed. The BUF marchers were dispersed towards Hyde Park instead while the anti-fascists rioted with police. About 150 demonstrators were arrested, although some escaped with the help of other demonstrators. Around 175 people were injured including police, women and children.

The battle of the Cable Street was one of the heaviest riots in London since 1919.;Die Schlacht in der Cable Street war eine Straßenschlacht, die am Sonntag, den 4. Oktober 1936, im London stattfand. Es war bekannt geworden, dass die 'British Union of Fascists' einen Marsch durch das von Arbeitern und Juden geprägte East End Viertel planten. Oswald Mosley, Führer der britischen Faschisten, plante tausende seiner nach dem Vorbild der ital. Schwarzhemden uniformierten Gefolgsleute aufmarschieren zu lassen. Viele Bewohner des East Ends forderten den Minister des Heimatministeriums John Simon dazu auf, den Marsch aufgrund von erwarteten Ausschreitungen zu verbieten. Simons lehnte ab und beauftragte die Polizei den Schutz des Marsches zu übernehmen und etwaige Ausschreitungen zu verhindern. Der britische Zentralrat der Juden verurteilte den Marsch als antisemitisch und rief Juden dazu auf fern zu bleiben. Phil Piratin, Mitglied der brit. kommunistischen Partei, organisierte in aller Eile Gegendemonstranten. Die Demonstranten errichteten auf der Marschroute in der langen, engen Cable Street, nahe der Kreuzung Christian Street, Straßensperren, um den Marsch zu unterbinden. Hier trafen nun die fast 7.000 Mann starke Londoner Polizeieskorte auf die fast 20.000 Mann starke Gegengruppe. Die Polizei machte sich daran die Straßensperren aufzulösen, worauf es zu heftigen Tumulten und Schlägereien kam. Nach einer Reihe brutaler und blutiger Kämpfe auf und entlang der Cable Street entschied sich Mosley dazu den Marsch seiner 3.000 Faschisten zu unterlassen, um weiteres Blutvergießen zu beenden. Während der Kämpfe wurden an die 150 Aufständische verhaftet, wobei es anderen gelang durch die Hilfe der Demonstranten unerkannt zu entkommen. Außerdem wurden über 175 Personen, darunter Frauen und Kinder, verletzt.

Während der 1920er und 1930er Jahre hatte die finnische Regierung mehr Geld für die Armee bereit gestellt. Diese war versucht auf dem Markt neue, moderne Waffensysteme und Ausrüstung zu erwerben. Als die Sowjetunion 1939 Finnland überfiel, befand sich die finnische Armee in einer verzweifelten Lage. Die geringen Mengen an schweren Waffen, Munition und Vorräten machten einen Krieg fast unmöglich. Finnland ging jetzt dazu über alles an Waffen zu erstehen, was nur irgendwie erhältlich war. Einige Nationen schenken Finnland sogar Waffen und Munition. Nach dem Ende des Winterkrieges war sich Finnland sicher, dass es erneut zu einem Krieg gegen die Sowjetunion kommen würde. Finnland hatte in den Jahren gute Beziehungen zu Deutschland aufgebaut und nach dessen Sieg war der Wehrmacht unzähliges Material der französischen Armee in die Hände gefallen. Finnland wand sich nun mit der Bitte eben jenes Material sowie zusätzlich deutsches Material zu kaufen an die Regierung in Berlin. Die Deutschen stimmten dem finnischen Gesuch zu. /n /n Von 1940 an verkauften die Deutschen französische und deutsche Panzerabwehrkanonen, Flak sowie Artilleriekanonen in nicht unerheblichen Mengen nach Finnland.
